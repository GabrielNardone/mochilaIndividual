        Roughly, three main schools of thought have emerged in response
to the general questions concerning the conditions of
legal validity: According to one school of thought—called legal
positivism, which emerged during the early nineteenth century3
and has retained considerable influence ever since—the conditions
of legal validity are constituted by social facts. Legality is
constituted by a complex set of facts relating to people’s actions,
beliefs, and attitudes, and those social facts basically exhaust the
conditions of legal validity. As we will see in the first two chapters,
a very important aspect of the debate here relates to the possibility
of reduction: Can the conditions of legal validity be reduced to
facts of a non-normative type?

    </p>

    <p>
        Another school of thought, originating in a much older tradition,
called natural law, maintains that the conditions of legal
validity—though necessarily tied to actions and events that take
place—are not exhausted by those law-creating acts/events. The
content of the putative norm, mostly its moral content, also bears
on its legal validity. Normative content that does not meet a certain
minimal threshold of moral acceptability cannot be legally
valid. As the famous dictum of St. Augustine has it: lex iniusta
non est lex (unjust law is not law). Whether this view is rightly
attributable to the Thomist natural law tradition, as it often has
been, is a contentious issue, but one that I will not consider in any
detail here;4 and whether it is a view that still has any philosophical
support is questionable.

    </p>

        A third view about the conditions of legal validity, which has
drawn some inspiration from the Natural Law tradition but differs
from it in essential details, maintains that moral content is
not a necessary condition of legality, but it may be a sufficient one.
According to this view, moral-political reasoning is sometimes
sufficient to conclude that a certain normative content is legally
valid, that it forms part of the law in a given context. As we shall
see in chapter 4, there are two main versions of this view: one
articulated by Ronald Dworkin and another that has emerged as
a significant modification of traditional legal positivism.
